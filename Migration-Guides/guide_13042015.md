This guide is intended to help game developers migrate their games to the new Whow Games staging environment.

Our old staging environment will continue to work till the **24.04.2015**.  
Afterwards it will be shut down by our devops team.

##Staging URL Change##

We have changed our development environment and therefore our staging environment URLs. All API related credentials and user accounts have been migrated and will still be working on the new system. 

New REST API Staging URL

New Casino Staging URL
><http://staging-1-www.jackpot.de>
