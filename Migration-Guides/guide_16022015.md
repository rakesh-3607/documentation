#REST API & Frontend Migration Guide#
**Publish date: February 16, 2015**  
**Published by: Felix Schemmer <<f.schemmer@whow.net>>**

This guide is intended to help game developers migrate their games to the next API & Frontend version.  
The migration has to be done till the deadline date, stated below, to make sure that your games are running fine after the deadline because old feature might be turned off afterwards.

Migration deadline: March 30, 2015

##REST API Integration Changes with 1.1##

###Periodic querying of GameSessions::wallet###

Since the games do no longer receive additional currency information from the casino via easyXDM methods ([see frontend changes](#Removal-of-easyXDM)) you need to query the REST API to request up-to-date wallet information. Since you are already receiving up-to-date information after each call (bet, close, play) it would be good to only request the wallet if your game has gone into some kind of idle state to prevent spamming of messages. If the player has not done any action in 30 seconds and the game is therefore in idle state you can call the REST API every 10 to 30 seconds to fetch the wallet and its balance. This can be achieved by using the existing call `GameSessions::wallet`.

`GameSessions::wallet` does return a fully wallet object within the payload response.  
For more information see the corresponding REST API documentation.

##Frontend Integration Changes with 0.4##

###Removal of easyXDM###

Seeing easyXDM taking a fair share of integration time and that a lot of game developers were struggling to get easyXDM running we decided to remove it completely. Therefore there will be no need to pass the REST API payload to the surrounding casino anymore, since we take care the data gets where it needs to be. The only connection to the casino that still remains are the GET parameters in the game URI.

**Sound on Runtime**  
Sound changes won't be communicated at runtime anymore since users don't change the sound often. We will reload the game with updated GET parameters.

**Chip Updates on Runtime**  
Most of the time chip updates will be communicated when the player places a bet or wins chips. However, if the user does nothing for a few seconds or minutes the wallet might get out of sync. To prevent this you need to call the REST API periodically, in case the game is in idle state, to fetch the up-to-date wallet and balance. This change is directly related to [Periodic querying of GameSessions::wallet](#Periodic-querying-of-GameSessions::wallet).
